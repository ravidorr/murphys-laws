# Murphy's Laws - iOS App

Native iOS application for browsing Murphy's Laws, voting on favorites, and calculating the probability of tasks going wrong using Sod's Law formula.

## Features

- **Law of the Day**: Discover a new Murphy's Law every day
- **Browse Laws**: Explore the complete archive with search and filters
- **Categories**: Filter laws by technology, office, daily life, and more
- **Voting**: Vote on your favorite laws to help others discover them
- **Sod's Law Calculator**: Calculate the probability of your task going wrong
- **Submit Laws**: Contribute your own Murphy's Law variations

## Requirements

- iOS 16.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.7+

## Quick Start

### For First-Time Setup (Automated)

The iOS source code is complete. Generate the Xcode project automatically:

**Option 1: Using the setup script**
```bash
cd ios
./generate-xcode-project.sh
open MurphysLaws.xcodeproj
```

**Option 2: Using Make**
```bash
cd ios
make setup # Generate Xcode project
make open # Open in Xcode
```

**Prerequisites**: Install [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

### For First-Time Setup (Manual)

If you prefer manual setup or don't have XcodeGen:

1. Open Xcode and create a new iOS App project
2. Save to this `ios/` directory with name `MurphysLaws`
3. Import the source files into your Xcode project
4. Configure Info.plist and Assets

**See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.**

### If Xcode Project Already Exists

```bash
cd ios
open MurphysLaws.xcodeproj
```

Then press `⌘R` to build and run.

## Architecture

The app follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with a Repository pattern:

```
MurphysLaws/
├── App/                # App entry point and navigation
├── Models/             # Data models (Law, Category, Attribution, Vote)
├── Views/              # SwiftUI views organized by feature
│ ├── Home/             # Law of the Day and featured content
│ ├── Browse/           # Law browsing and detail views
│ ├── Categories/       # Category browsing
│ ├── Calculator/       # Sod's Law Calculator
│ ├── Submit/           # Law submission form
│ ├── More/             # Settings and about
│ └── Shared/           # Reusable components
├── ViewModels/         # Business logic and state management
├── Services/           # API and voting services
├── Repositories/       # Data access layer with caching
└── Utilities/          # Constants and helpers
```

**Architecture Details**: See [Mobile Architecture](../shared/docs/MOBILE-ARCHITECTURE.md#ios-architecture)

## Configuration

### API Endpoint

The app connects to: `https://murphys-laws.com/api/v1`

For local development, modify `baseURL` in `Utilities/Constants.swift`:

```swift
static let baseURL = "http://localhost:8787/api/v1"
```

### Storage

- **User Votes**: Persisted in UserDefaults with device ID
- **Category Cache**: 1-hour TTL
- **Law of the Day Cache**: 24-hour TTL

## Testing

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Law of the Day loads and displays
- [ ] Browse shows laws with pagination
- [ ] Search and filtering work
- [ ] Voting persists and updates counts
- [ ] Calculator computes correctly
- [ ] Share functionality works

### Unit Tests

```bash
# In Xcode: Press ⌘U

# Or via command line
xcodebuild test \
 -project MurphysLaws.xcodeproj \
 -scheme MurphysLaws \
 -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'

# Or using Make
make test
```

**Test Coverage:**
- `LawListViewModelTests` - Browse, search, and filtering
- `HomeViewModelTests` - Law of the day and featured content
- `CalculatorViewModelTests` - Sod's Law probability calculator
- UI tests for navigation, voting, search, and calculator

## Documentation

- **Setup Guide**: [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) - Detailed Xcode setup instructions
- **PRD**: [iOS PRD](../shared/docs/MOBILE-IOS-PRD.md) - Complete feature specifications
- **API**: [API Documentation](../shared/docs/API.md) - Backend API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

**Build errors**: Ensure all files are added to Xcode target
**API fails**: Verify `baseURL` in Constants.swift
**Votes not saving**: Check device ID generation in DeviceID.swift

See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md#troubleshooting) for detailed troubleshooting.

## Status

## Contributing

When adding features:
1. Follow MVVM architecture
2. Use `@MainActor` for ViewModels
3. Implement error handling with `ContentUnavailableView`
4. Add loading states with `ProgressView`
5. Support pull-to-refresh
