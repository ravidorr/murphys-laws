        Murphy's Law Archive preserves and celebrates the world's favorite truism about
        inevitable mishaps. What started as a personal collection has become a living
        repository for witty observations, cautionary tales, and the humor we need when
        plans go sideways.

      <h2><span class="accent-text">What</span> is Murphy's Law?</h2>
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
        "Anything that can go wrong, will." - Capt. Edward A. Murphy Jr.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Born out of an Air Force experiment in 1949, Murphy's Law captured a universal truth:
        when the stakes are high and complexity reigns, something eventually slips. Over the
        decades, this simple idea has multiplied into corollaries, variations, and stories from
        every corner of life, each reminding us to prepare, adapt, and laugh.

      <h2><span class="accent-text">How</span> It Happened</h2>
      <p>
        Founder <strong>Raanan Avidor</strong> launched the archive in the late 1990s after a single
        Murphy moment on a Geocities page sparked an avalanche of emails. That snowball grew into a
        structured archive, a modern web app, and a shared space for everyone who appreciates the
        instructional power of things going wrong.
