        Murphy's Law Archive is built for curious, privacy-conscious readers. This policy explains
        what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we protect your trust while you
        browse, submit laws, and share your stories.

          <h3><span class="accent-text">Information</span> You Share</h3>
          <p>
            When you submit a law, send feedback, or subscribe to updates, you may share your name,
            email address, and the content you contribute. Sharing is optional - the archive welcomes
            anonymous submissions.

          <h3><span class="accent-text">Activity</span> Signals</h3>
          <p>
            Our servers automatically receive technical basics like IP address, device and browser
            details, pages visited, and time on page. These signals help us keep the site reliable
            and understand what content resonates.

        We use lightweight first-party cookies and privacy-focused analytics to understand traffic
        trends. They remember preferences like dark mode and help us learn which calculators or laws
        people return to most. You can clear or block cookies through your browser without breaking

      <p>
        When enabled, services such as email delivery providers or advertising networks may process
        limited information to send notifications or measure reach. We require these partners to honor
        strong privacy safeguards and only share the minimum necessary data.

      <h2><span class="accent-text">Data</span> Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Submission content remains visible so the archive reflects collective wisdom. Supporting
        metadata is retained only as long as we have a reason - typically to provide the feature you
        requested or to comply with legal obligations. When data is no longer needed, we delete or
        anonymize it.

      <h2><span class="accent-text">Security</span> Practices</h2>
      <p>
        We apply encryption in transit, strict access controls, and regular reviews of our systems.
        While no website can promise absolute security, we respond quickly to issues and keep backups
        isolated from public infrastructure.

      <h2><span class="accent-text">Global</span> Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Murphy's Law is universal, and so are our visitors. Data may be processed in the United States
        and other regions where our providers operate. Using the site means you consent to that
        transfer, and we rely on standard contractual safeguards when required.

      <h2><span class="accent-text">Updates</span></h2>

        We review this policy whenever new features launch or regulations change. When updates happen,
        we adjust the date at the top and summarize material changes so you can stay informed.
