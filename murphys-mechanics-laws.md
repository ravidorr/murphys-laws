#Murphy's Mechanics laws
* If it doesn't fit, force it. If it breaks, it needed replacing anyway.
* If you drop a tool or small part while working on a car, it will roll to the exact center underneath the vehicle.
* If you have enough grease & a big enough hammer, you can put anything anywhere. Sent by J.C. Rolston.
* Any instrument when dropped will roll into the least accessible corner.
    * Corollary: It will not roll if it falls on shag carpeting and is small enough to hide.
* If you drop a tool or a part it will roll to the exact center underneath your car thus extending your repair enjoyment. Sent by [Tim Salo](mailto:tsalo@drew.edu), Madison, NJ.
