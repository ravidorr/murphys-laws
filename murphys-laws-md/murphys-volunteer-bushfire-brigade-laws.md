# Murphy's Volunteer Bushfire Brigade Laws

* Don't look conspicuous. When you’re dealing with the public, this can lead to stupid questions. Back on Station, it can lead to Crew Leaders.  
* There is always an easy way.  
  * Corollary: The easy way usually results in more damage done than less or is blocked by a large, pissed off dog who hasn't eaten in a week.  
* When dealing with the public, try to appear unimportant. They may find someone else to ask that stupid question to.  
* Falling trees have the right of way.  
* Uniforms only come in two sizes: too small and too large.  
* If your Captain can see you, then so can the public.  
* Never worry about the falling tree branch with your name on it.  
* Instead, worry about the falling tree addressed, "To whom it may concern".  
* If orders can be misunderstood, they have been.  
* It isn't necessary to be an idiot to be a senior officer, but it sure helps.  
* Crew Leaders, not GOD, make priorities. There’s a difference.  
* Never stand when you can sit, never sit when you can lie down, never stay awake when you can sleep.  
* Never tell the Captain or Deputy Captain you have nothing to do.  
* Crew leaders and above never watch until you make a mistake.  
* One Crew leader is never enough, but two is entirely too many.  
* A clean and dry set of overalls is a magnet for mud and rain.  
* The worse the weather, the more you must be in it.  
* The more an item of equipment costs, the farther you have to send it away to be repaired.  
* You don't get field experience until just after you need it.  
* Interchangeable parts \- don't.  
* Leak-proof seals \- will.  
* Self-starters \- won’t.  
* The pump is the equipment that usually won’t start or jam when you need it the most.   
* You aren't Superman.  
* If it's stupid but it works, it ain't stupid.  
* The important things are always simple.  
  * Corollary: The simple things are always difficult.  
* Beer Math \-\> 2 beers times 37 men equals 49 cases.  
* Never be the first, never be the last, and never volunteer to do anything.  
* The more stupid the leader is, the more important tasks he is ordered to carry out.  
* The self-importance of a Deputy Captain is inversely proportional to his actual importance in the chain of command.  
* Success occurs when no one is looking; failure occurs when the Fire Control Officer is watching.  
* As soon as hot food is served in the field, it rains. If only one solution for a field problem can be found, it is usually a stupid solution.  
* CHAOS \= Chiefs have arrived on scene. Sent by Sean.  
* Captain on location with heavy panic showing. Sent by Sean.  
* Chiefs are like diapers, always on your ass and full of shit. Sent by [Sean](mailto:Delcofd@hotmail.com).  
* Burning materials that require extinguishing by powder or gas will be treated with water. Sent by [Shlomo Targan](mailto:Shlomo.Targan@teva.co.il).
