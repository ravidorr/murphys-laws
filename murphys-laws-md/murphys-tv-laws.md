# Murphy's TV Laws

* The television show you once watched and loved will be discontinued. Sent by [Chiyvonne](mailto:harley_angel_3@yahoo.com).  
* If you watch a TV show only twice during the season, the second time will repeat the first. Sent by [Shonda Purvis](mailto:Shonda.Purvis@fnc.fujitsu.com).  
* If your VCR is set to tape your favorite program every day, and you find that at certain times it is taping nothing but reruns that you've already seen, the VCR tape will run out in the middle of the only program you haven't seen. Sent by [Linda King](mailto:lking32144@aol.com).  
* When you want to watch your favorite program, there is a blackout. Sent by [Yeeyeeyi@wmconnect.com](http://Yeeyeeyi@wmconnect.com).  
* When you want to record your favorite program so you can watch it repeatedly, you are recording the wrong channel. Sent by [Yeeyeeyi@wmconnect.com](http://Yeeyeeyi@wmconnect.com).
