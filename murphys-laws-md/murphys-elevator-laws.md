# Murphy's Elevator Laws

* The last man entering an elevator going up goes to the lowest floor. Sent by [Dimple Venigalla](mailto:dimplekv@yahoo.com).  
* Conversely, if you are in a descending elevator, the last person to enter will punch the highest floor. Sent by [Bob McLaughlin](mailto:tideline@mindspring.com).  
* The first person needing to exit the elevator will always be the person farthest to the rear of the elevator. Sent by [Sandy Schlee](mailto:sandy.schlee@avenuea.com).  
* The chances of the elevator not working are inversely proportional to the weight you carry multiplied by the number of stairs you'll have to climb.
