# Murphy's Technology Laws

* Logic is a systematic method of coming to the wrong conclusion with confidence.  
* Whenever a system becomes completely defined, some damn fool discovers something which either abolishes the system or expands it beyond recognition.  
* Technology is dominated by those who manage what they do not understand.  
* If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.  
* The opulence of the front office decor varies inversely with the fundamental solvency of the firm.  
* A computer's attention span is only as long as its electrical cord.  
* An expert knows more and more about less and less until he knows everything about nothing.  
* Tell a man there are 300 billion stars in the universe, and he'll believe you. Tell him a bench has wet paint on it, and he'll have to touch it to be sure.  
  * Corollary: Great discoveries are made by mistake.  
* Always draw your curves, then plot your reading.  
* Nothing ever gets built on schedule or within budget.  
* All's well that ends well.  
* A meeting is when minutes are saved and hours are lost.  
* The first myth of management is that it exists.  
* A failure will not appear till a unit has passed final inspection.  
* New systems create new problems.  
* To err is human, but to foul things up requires a computer.  
* We don't know one millionth of one percent about anything.  
* Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Arthur C. Clark  
* A computer makes as many mistakes in two seconds as 20 men working 20 years make.  
* Nothing motivates a man more than to see his boss putting in an honest day's work.  
* Some people manage the book, even though they don't know who wrote it or what book it is.  
* The primary function of the design engineer is to make things difficult for the fabricator and impossible for the serviceman.  
* To spot the expert, choose the one who predicts the job will take the longest and cost the most.  
* After all is said and done, a hell of a lot more is said than done.  
* Any circuit design must contain at least one obsolete part, two unobtainable parts, and three parts still under development.  
* A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works.  
* If you get the incorrect answer mathematically, multiply by the page number.  
* Computers are unreliable, but humans are even more unreliable.  
  * Corollary: Any system that depends on human reliability is unreliable.  
* Give all orders verbally. Never write anything that might go into a "Pearl Harbor File."  
* Under the most rigorously controlled pressure, temperature, volume, humidity, and other variables, the organism will do as it pleases.  
* If you can't understand it, it is intuitively obvious.  
* The more cordial the buyer's secretary, the greater the odds the competition already has the order.  
* In designing any type of construction, no overall dimension can be totaled correctly after 4:30 p.m. on Friday.  
  * Corollary: The correct total will become self-evident at 8:15 a.m. on Monday.  
* Fill what's empty. Empty what's full. And scratch where it itches.  
* All things are possible except skiing through a revolving door.  
* The only perfect science is hindsight.  
* Work smarter and not harder, and be careful of your spelling.  
* If it's not in the computer, it doesn't exist.  
* If an experiment works, something has gone wrong.  
* When all else fails, read the instructions.  
* If several things could go wrong, the one that will cause the most damage will be the one that goes wrong first.  
* Everything that goes up must come down.  
  * Corollary: Not always. Sent by the [Dark Templar](mailto:templardark@hotmail.com).  
* Any instrument, when dropped, will roll into the least accessible corner.  
* Any simple theory will be formulated in the most complicated way.  
* Build a system that even a fool can use. Only a fool will want to use it.  
* The degree of technical competence is inversely proportional to the management level.  
* A difficult task will be halted near completion by one tiny, previously insignificant detail.  
* There is never time to do it right, but always time to do it over.  
* The remaining work to finish to reach your goal increases as the deadline approaches.  
* If there is ever the possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong. Sent by [Anthony Johnson](mailto:rhydderch@earthlink.net).  
* If something breaks and stops you from doing something, it will be fixed when you no longer need it, are in the middle of something else, or don't want it fixed because you don't want to do what you were supposed to.

* Assaf's Laws of Replacement Parts: A failed 25¢ part cannot be replaced by a new 25¢ part, but by a sub-assembly whose cost is equal to or greater than that of the device needing the part.  
  * Corollary: The cost and availability of a replacement part are inversely proportional to the price of the whole system: a $1500 device will fail because of the burnout of a 25¢ capacitor. But the 25¢ capacitor is either no longer manufactured, manufactured only by a company in Outer Mongolia with an 18-month backlog, or available only as part of a $1450 sub-assembly. Sent by [Francis Assaf](mailto:fassaf@charter.net).
