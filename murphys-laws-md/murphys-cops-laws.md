# Murphy's Cops Laws

* Bulletproof vests \- aren't.  
* The bigger they are, the harder they fall. They punch, kick, and choke harder, too.  
* How fast you respond to a fight call is inversely proportional to how long you've been a cop.  
* Tear gas works on cops, too, and regardless of wind direction, will always blow back in your face.  
* High-speed chases will always proceed from an area of light traffic to an area of extremely heavy traffic.  
* If you know someone who tortures animals and wets the bed, he is either a serial killer or he works for Internal Affairs.  
* Placing a gun back in a shoulder holster with your finger on the trigger will cause you to walk with a limp.  
* Flash suppressors don't really.  
* If you have 'cleared' all the rooms and met no resistance, you and your entry team have probably kicked in the wrong house's door.  
* If a cop swings a baton in a fight, he will hit other cops more often than the bad guys he swings at.  
* Domestic arguments will always migrate from an area with few available weapons (e.g., the living room) to an area with many available weapons (e.g., the kitchen).  
* If you have just punched out a handcuffed prisoner for spitting at you, you are about to become a star on 'Eyewitness News'.  
* Bullets work on veteran cops, too. They also work on weightlifters, martial arts experts, department sharpshooters, Narco Investigators, S.W.A.T. jocks, and others who consider themselves immortal.  
* When a civilian sees a red light approaching at a high rate of speed, he will always pull into the lane the cop needs to use.  
* If you drive your patrol car to the geometric center of the Gobi Desert, within five minutes, some dumb civilian will pull alongside you and ask for directions.  
* You can never drive slow enough to please the citizens who don't need a cop, and you can never drive fast enough to please the ones who do.  
* Any suspect with a rifle is a better shot than any cop with a pistol.  
* From behind you, the bad guys can see your night sights, and you can.  
* There will always be more 'bad guys' than 'good guys' on any call.  
  * Corrally: The farther away your back-up, the more there will be.  
* The longer you've been a cop, the shorter your flashlight and your temper get.  
* Whatever you are about to do, if there is a good chance it will get you killed, you probably shouldn't do it.  
* You should never do a shotgun search of a dark warehouse with a cop whose nickname is "Boomer."  
* The better you do your job, the more likely you will be shot, injured, complained about, sued, investigated, or subpoenaed on your day off.  
* If a large group of drunk bikers is "holed up" in a house, the Department will send one officer in a beat car. If one biker is "holed up" in a home, they will send the entire S. W. A. T. Team.  
* The likelihood that you are speaking to an undercover law enforcement officer is directly proportional to the number of personal questions being asked of you. Sent by [Fred Beeman](mailto:tomcruiseag@hotmail.com).  
* Dogs do not see the badge as a person of authority; they see lunch. Sent by [Ryan Parton](mailto:ryan@techqwest.net).  
* Laser sights work both ways. Sent by [Oxender, Chad, SSgt 321 ESPTS/SFS](mailto:chad.oxender@miab.aorcentaf.af.mil).  
* Cops arrive late to the crime scene. Sent by [Ishola Stephen](mailto:s_ishola@hotmail.com).  
* The number of years on the job is directly proportional to your waistline. Sent by Zain  
* The number of people locking their keys in their car is directly proportional to how bad the weather is. Sent by [Christina N.](mailto:cneidert@hotmail.com)  
* Generally, a person's innocence is often opposed to how much they insist they are. Sent by [Darrell A. Pierce](mailto:agentwulf@comcast.net).  
* Any time you decide to do something, even slightly against the law, a police officer will be near enough to see it happen. Sent by [Lloupiermuingz](mailto:uninvited_ice@hotmail.com).  
* Swiderski's Law: Every thorough investigation leads to confusion. Sent by [Gregory Swiderski](mailto:gaswiderski@copper.net).  
* Your testimony in court is unnecessary until you and your wife coordinate the same time off work together.  
* Always give the guy who complains about paying your salary his nickel back before you write his ticket; It will leave him with a better impression of your services.  
* The further away the call is into the sticks, the more likely you are to need a restroom after you are back in service.  
* Nobody needs a cop while the cop is around.  
* Cops are society's Sacrificial Lambs. Hey, at least we're not their Jackasses. That would be the Brass.  
* Even when you're not on call, you're on call. Just ask the sergeant, who doesn't want to be called.  
* On an extended Crime Scene, when someone shows up with the doughnuts and coffee, the cops who usually get them are standing around doing nothing, and could have gone themselves.
