[^1]: Most cowboys know of Murphy's Law, what they may not know is that Murphy, in his wisdom, wrote his laws for CAS long before it came into existence.Back then CAS wasn't yet a proven science or art form like it is today and things could actually go wrong with firearms, ammo, stage props, spurs, etc. and some cowboys, as hard as it is the believe, actually missed.It was for these reasons that Capt. Murphy wrote his famous laws for Cowboy Action Shooting.
