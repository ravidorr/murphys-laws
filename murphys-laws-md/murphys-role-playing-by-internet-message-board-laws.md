# Murphy's Role-Playing by Internet Message Board Laws

* Nobody knows whose fault it is that the story isn't moving.  
  * Corollary 1: Everyone has a theory.  
  * Corollary 2: Every theory is different.  
* The Game Master is never on ICQ.  
* Neither are any of the other players.  
* The impossibility of slapping someone silly over the net is not recognized as a potential weakness that requires careful consideration, but is abused as if there were no tomorrow.  
  * Corollary 1: After you spend a few hours trying to modify the text so that you get a coherent string of events from the garbled message of a player, he'll announce that you suck and quit the game.  
  * Corollary 2: Just when you've written a convincing message detailing how the now inactive character is disposed of, the player will come back and bitch at you for forcing him out.
