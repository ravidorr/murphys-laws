# Murphy's Sewing Laws

* Fusible interfacings always fuse to the iron.  
* The serge only eats the customer's garment.  
* You will find five buttons in your box if you need six.  
* The seam you meant to rip out is invariably the other one.  
* When you are in a hurry, the needle eye is always too small.  
* The fabric you forgot to pre-shrink will always shrink the most.  
* The pattern you wanted to make again will have one key piece missing.  
* If you drop something out of your sewing basket, it will be your box of pins, with the cover off.  
* Whenever the construction process is going well, the bobbin thread runs out.  
* The magnitude of the goof is in direct proportion to the cost of the fabric.  
* While walking barefoot, your lost needle will be found by your son, husband, or brother-in-law.  
* Facings tend to be sewn to the wrong side.  
  * Corollary: Opposite sides attract.  
* Collar points don't match, and you've trimmed all the seams.  
* The iron never scorches the garment until its final pressing.  
* The steam iron only burps rusty water on light silk fabric.  
* The sewing machine light usually burns out on Sunday.  
* Pinking shears get dull just by looking at them.  
* Gathering threads always breaks in the middle.  
* The scissors cut easiest past the buttonhole.  
* Matching edges don't. Sent by [Barb](mailto:pineglen@discover-net.net).  
* You will spill your pin box once per garment. Sent by [Barb](mailto:pineglen@discover-net.net), on behalf of his sister.  
* As ye sew, so shall ye rip. Sent by [EJ Mott](mailto:ejmott@mchsi.com), passed to her by her grandmother.
