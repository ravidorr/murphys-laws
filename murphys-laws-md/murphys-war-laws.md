# Murphy's War Laws

* Friendly fire \- isn't.  
* Recoilless rifles \- aren't.  
* Suppressive fires \- won't.  
* You are not Superman; Marines and fighter pilots take note.  
* A sucking chest wound is Nature's way of telling you to slow down.  
* If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid.  
* Try to look unimportant; the enemy may be low on ammo and not want to waste a bullet on you.  
* If at first you don't succeed, call in an air strike.  
* If you are ahead of your position, your artillery will fall short.  
* Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than yourself.  
* Never go to bed with anyone crazier than yourself.  
* Remember, the lowest bidder made your weapon.  
* If your attack is going well, it's an ambush.  
* The enemy diversion you're ignoring is their main attack.  
* The enemy invariably attacks on two occasions:  
  * When they're ready.  
  * When you're not.  
* No OPLAN ever survives initial contact.  
* There is no such thing as a perfect plan.  
* Five-second fuses always burn three seconds.  
* There is no such thing as an atheist in a foxhole.  
* A retreating enemy is probably just falling back and regrouping.  
  * The Ol' Ranger's addendum: Or else they're trying to suck you into a serious ambush\!  
* The important things are always simple; the simple are always difficult.  
* The easy way is always mined.  
* Teamwork is essential; it gives the enemy other people to shoot at.  
* Don't look conspicuous; it draws fire. For this reason, it is not uncommon for aircraft carriers to be known as bomb magnets.  
* Never draw fire; it irritates everyone around you.  
* You are in the combat zone if you are short of everything but the enemy.  
* When you have secured the area, ensure the enemy knows it too.  
* Incoming fire has the right of way.  
* No combat-ready unit has ever passed inspection.  
* No inspection-ready unit has ever passed combat.  
* If the enemy is within range, so are you.  
* The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is incoming friendly fire.  
* Things that must be shipped together as a set aren't.  
* Things that must work together can't be carried to the field that way.  
* Radios will fail once you need fire support.  
* Radar tends to fail at night, in bad weather, and especially during both.)  
* Anything you do can get you killed, including nothing.  
* Make it too tough for the enemy to get in, and you won't be able to get out.  
* Tracers work both ways.  
* If you take more than your fair share of objectives, you will get more than your fair share of objectives to take.  
* They're both right when both sides are convinced they're about to lose.  
* Professional soldiers are predictable; the world is full of dangerous amateurs.  
* Military Intelligence is a contradiction.  
* Fortify your front; you'll get your rear shot up.  
* The weather ain't neutral.  
* If you can't remember, the Claymore is pointed toward you.  
* Air defense motto: shoot 'em down; sort 'em out on the ground.  
* 'Flies high, it dies; low and slow, it'll go.  
* The Cavalry doesn't always come to the rescue.  
* Napalm is an area support weapon.  
* Mines are equal opportunity weapons.  
* B-52s are the ultimate close support weapon.  
* Sniper's motto: reach out and touch someone.  
* Killing for peace is like screwing for virginity.  
* The one item you need is always in short supply.  
* Interchangeable parts aren't.  
* It's not the one with your name on it; it's the one addressed "to whom  
* It may concern" you've got to think about.  
* When in doubt, empty your magazine.  
* The side with the simplest uniforms wins.  
* Combat will occur on the ground between two adjoining maps.  
* If the Platoon Sergeant can see you, so can the enemy.  
* Never stand when you can sit, never sit when you can lie down, never stay awake when you can sleep.  
* The most dangerous thing in the world is a Second Lieutenant with a map and a compass.  
* Exceptions prove the rule, and destroy the battle plan.  
* Everything always works in your HQ and fails in the Colonel's HQ.  
* The enemy never watches until you make a mistake.  
* One enemy soldier is never enough, but two is entirely too many.  
* A clean (and dry) set of BDU's is a magnet for mud and rain.  
* The worse the weather, the more you must be in it.  
* Whenever you have plenty of ammo, you never miss. You can't hit the broad side of a barn whenever you are low on ammo.  
* The more a weapon costs, the farther you must send it away to be repaired.  
* The complexity of a weapon is inversely proportional to the IQ of the weapon's operator.  
* You don't get field experience until just after you need it.  
* No matter which way you have to march, it's always uphill.  
* If enough data is collected, a board of inquiry can prove anything.  
* For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism. (in boot camp)  
* Air strikes always overshoot the target, and artillery always falls short.  
* When reviewing the radio frequencies you wrote down, the most important ones are always illegible.  
* Those who hesitate under fire usually do not end up KIA or WIA.  
* The difficult part about being an officer is that the troops don't know what they want but know what they don't like.  
* Stealing information from a person is called plagiarism. Stealing information from the enemy is called gathering intelligence.  
* The weapon that usually jams when you need it the most is the M60.  
* The perfect officer for the job will transfer on the day after that billet is filled by someone else.  
* When you have sufficient supplies & ammo, the enemy takes 2 weeks to attack.  
  * Corollary: When you are low on supplies & ammo, the enemy decides to attack that night.  
* The newest and least experienced soldier will usually win the Medal of Honor.  
* A Purple Heart proves that you were smart enough to think of a plan, stupid enough to try it, and lucky enough to survive.  
* Murphy was a grunt.  
* Beer Math: 2 beers times 37 men equals 49 cases.  
* Body count Math: 3 guerrillas plus one probable plus two pigs equals 37 enemies killed in action.  
* The bursting radius of a hand grenade is always one foot greater than your jumping range.  
* All-weather close air support doesn't work in bad weather.  
* The combat worth of a unit is inversely proportional to the smartness of its outfit and appearance.  
* The crucial round is a dud.  
* Every command that can be misunderstood will be.  
* There is no place like a convenient foxhole.  
* Never be the first, never be the last, and never volunteer to do anything.  
* If your positions are firmly set and you are prepared to take the enemy assault on, he will bypass you.  
* The enemy won't walk into your ambush if properly set.  
* If your flank march is going well, the enemy expects you to outflank him.  
* Fire density increases proportionally to the target's curiosity.  
* Odd objects attract fire \- never lurk behind one.  
* The more stupid the leader is, the more important missions he is ordered to carry out.  
* The self-importance of a superior is inversely proportional to his position in the hierarchy (as is his deviousness and mischievousness).  
* There is always a way, and it usually doesn't work.  
* Success occurs when no one is looking; failure occurs when the General is watching.  
* The enemy never monitors your radio frequency until you broadcast on an unsecured channel.  
* Whenever you drop your equipment in a firefight, your ammo and grenades always fall the farthest away, and your canteen always lands at your feet.  
* It rains when you are served hot chow in the field.  
* Never tell the Platoon Sergeant you have nothing to do.  
* The seriousness of a wound (in a firefight) is inversely proportional to the distance to any form of cover.  
* Walking point \= sniper bait.  
* Your bivouac for the night is the spot where you got tired of marching that day.  
* If only one solution for a field problem can be found, it is usually a stupid solution.  
* No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.  
* The most dangerous in a combat zone is an officer with a map.  
* The problem with taking the easy way out is that the enemy has already mined it.  
* The buddy system is essential to your survival; it gives the enemy somebody else to shoot at.  
* If your advance is going well, you are walking into an ambush.  
* The quartermaster has only two sizes: too large and too small.  
* If you need an officer in a hurry, take a nap.  
* The only time suppressive fireworks are used is on abandoned positions.  
* Nothing is more satisfying than having someone take a shot at you and miss.  
* Don't be conspicuous. In the combat zone, it draws fire. Out of the combat zone, it draws sergeants.  
* If you see you, so can the enemy.  
* All or any of the above combined.  
* Avoid loud noises; there are few silent killers in a combat zone. Sent by [Hank Samples](mailto:HankS982@aol.com), A Vietnam Nam combat veteran (70-72), 11th ACR-101st Abn.  
* Never screw over a buddy; you'll never know when he could save your life. Sent by [Hank Samples](mailto:HankS982@aol.com), A Vietnam Nam combat veteran (70-72), 11th ACR-101st Abn.  
* Never expect rations; the only rations that will be on time and won't be short are the rations of shit. Sent by [Hank Samples](mailto:HankS982@aol.com), A Vietnam Nam combat veteran (70-72), 11th ACR-101st Abn.

* Some General's last words (as his aides tried to get him to get his head down): "What\! What\! Men, dodging this way for single bullets\! What will you do when they open fire along the whole line?
