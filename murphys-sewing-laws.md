# Murphy's Sewing Laws
* Fusible interfacings always fuse to the iron.
* The serge only eats the customer's garment.
* If you need 6 buttons, you will find 5 in your button box.
* The seam you meant to rip out is invariably the other one.
* When you are in a hurry, the needle eye is always too small.
* The fabric you forgot to pre-shrink will always shrink the most.
* The pattern you wanted to make again will have one key piece missing.
* If you drop something out of your sewing basket, it will be your box of pins, with the cover off.
* Whenever the construction process is going well, the bobbin thread runs out.
* The magnitude of the goof is in direct proportion to the cost of the fabric.
* Your lost needle will be found by your son, husband or brother-in-law, while walking around barefoot.
* Facings tend to be sewn to the wrong side.
    * Corollary: Opposite sides attract.
* Collar points don't match, and you've trimmed all the seams.
* The iron never scorches the garment until its final pressing.
* The steam iron only burps rusty water on light silk fabric.
* The sewing machine light usually burns out on Sunday.
* Pinking shears get dull just by looking at them.
* Gathering threads always break in the middle.
* The scissors cut easiest past the buttonhole.
* Matching edges don't. Sent by [Barb](mailto:pineglen@discover-net.net).
* You will spill your pin box once per garment. Sent by [Barb](mailto:pineglen@discover-net.net), on behalf of his sister.
* As ye sew, so shall ye rip. Sent by [EJ Mott](mailto:ejmott@mchsi.com), passed to her by her grandmother.
