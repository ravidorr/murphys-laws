#Murphy's Role-Playing by Internet Message Board Laws
Nobody knows whose fault it is that the story isn't moving, but everyone has a different theory.
* The Game Master is never on ICQ.
* Neither are any of the other players.
* The impossibility of slapping someone silly over the net is not recognized as potential weak point that requires careful consideration, but abused as if there was no tomorrow.
    * Corollary 1: After you spent a few hours trying to modify the text so that you get a coherent string of events from the garbled message of a player, he'll announce that you suck and quit the game.
    * Corollary 2: Just when you've written a convincing message detailing how the now inactive character is disposed of, the player will come back and bitch at you for forcing him out.
