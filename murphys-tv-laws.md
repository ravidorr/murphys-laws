#Murphy's TV Laws
* The television show that you watched once and loved will be discontinued. Sent by [Chiyvonne](mailto:harley_angel_3@yahoo.com).
* If you watch a TV show only twice during the season, the second time will be a repeat of the first. Sent by [Shonda Purvis](mailto:Shonda.Purvis@fnc.fujitsu.com).
* If your VCR is set to tape your favorite program every day, and you find that at certain times it is taping nothing but reruns that you've already seen, the VCR tape will run out in the middle of the only program that you haven't already seen. Sent by [Linda King](mailto:lking32144@aol.com).
* When you want to watch your favorite program, there is a black out. Sent by [Yeeyeeyi@wmconnect.com](Yeeyeeyi@wmconnect.com).
* When you want to record your favorite program so you can watch it over and over again, you were recording the wrong channel. Sent by [Yeeyeeyi@wmconnect.com](Yeeyeeyi@wmconnect.com).
