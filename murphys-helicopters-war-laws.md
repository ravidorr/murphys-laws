#Murphy's Helicopters Warfare Laws
* Helicopter tail rotors are naturally drawn toward trees, stumps, rocks, etc. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
    * Corollary: While it may be possible to ward off this event some of the time, it cannot, despite the best efforts of the crew, always be prevented. It's just what they do. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* The engine RPM and the rotor RPM must BOTH be kept in the GREEN. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
    * Corollary: Failure to heed this commandment can adversely affect the morale of the crew. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* The terms Protective Armor and Helicopter are mutually exclusive. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* "Chicken Plates" are not something you order in a restaurant. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* The BSR (Bang Stare Red) Law: The louder the sudden bang in the helicopter, the quicker your eyes will be drawn to the gauges. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
    * Corollary: The longer you stare at the gauges the less time it takes them to move from green to red. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* Loud, sudden noises in a helicopter WILL get your undivided attention. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* The further you fly into the mountains, the louder the strange engine noises become. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* It is a bad thing to run out of airspeed, altitude and ideas all at the same time. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* "Pucker Factor" is the formal name of the equation that states the more hairy the situation is, the more of the seat cushion will be sucked up your butt. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
    * Corollary: It can be expressed in its mathematical formula of: S (suction) + H (height above ground) + I (interest in staying alive) + T (# of tracers coming your way). Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
    * Corollary: Thus the term 'SHIT!' can also be used to denote a situation where a high Pucker Factor is being encountered. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* Running out of pedal, fore or aft cyclic, or collective are all bad ideas. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
    * Corollary: Any combination of these can be deadly. Sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of his brother-in-law, CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret).
* Helicopters have been described as nothing more than 50,000 parts flying in close formation. It is the mechanics responsibility to keep that formation as tight as possible. Sent by [Darrell A. Pierce](mailto:agentwulf@comcast.net).
* It is mathematically impossible for either hummingbirds, or helicopters to fly. Fortunately, neither are aware of this. Sent by [Darrell A. Pierce](mailto:agentwulf@comcast.net).
* LZ's are always hot. Sent by [loony39478@yahoo.com](loony39478@yahoo.com)
* There are 'old' pilots and 'bold' pilots, but there are no 'old, bold' pilots.
* Any helicopter pilot story that starts "There I was,...." will be either true or false. Sent by Brad Lucas, CPT, AV USA Ret, and a 1st Gulf War Vet.
* Any of these stories that end with "No shit." was neither true nor false. Sent by [Brad Lucas](mailto:belucas@hayes-lemmerz.com), CPT, AV USA Ret, and a 1st Gulf War Vet.
* The mark of a truly superior pilot is the use of his superior judgment to avoid situations requiring the use of his superior skill. Sent by Brad Lucas, CPT, AV USA Ret, and a 1st Gulf War Vet.
* Ch-53's are living proof, that if you strap enough engines to something it will fly. Sent by [Jason Koeck](mailto:jasonkoeck@yahoo.com).
