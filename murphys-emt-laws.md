# Murphy's EMT Laws
* Air goes in and out, blood goes round and round, any variation on this is bad.
* Try not to discuss "your day" at the family dinner table.
* You may not install a "car catcher" on the front of the ambulance.
* The more equipment you see on a EMT's belt, the newer they are.
* Examine all chest clutchers first, bleeders next, then the rest of the whiners.
* When dealing with citizens, if it felt good saying it, it was wrong.
* All bleeding stops. eventually.
* You can't cure stupidity.
* If it's wet and sticky and not yours - leave it alone!
* "Riding shotgun" does not mean you shoot the tires of non-yielding vehicles.
* If at all possible, avoid any edible item that fire fighters prepare.
* EMS is extended periods of boredom, interrupted by moments of sheer terror.
* Every emergency has three phases: Panic. Fear. Remorse.
* A good tape job will fix almost anything.
* Yuppies involved in accidents complain how bumpy the ambulance ride is.
* It's not a compliment when Policemen say you're crude, crass & cynical.
* The severity of the injury is directly proportional to the weight of the patient.
* Turret mounted machine guns usually work better than lights and sirens.
* Schedule your days off to avoid working during full phases of the Moon.
* "textbook case" - isn't.
* You've come to conclude 90% of all drunks are a waste of protoplasm.
* Never refer to someone in respiratory distress as a "Smurf".
* Automatically multiply by 3 the number of drinks they claim to have had.
* Your social skills will be lacking, if all your anecdotes deal with blood.
* Assume every female between 6 and 106 is pregnant until proven otherwise.
* Nothing is as scary as a quiet child.
* Don't place bets on the glucose level of an unresponsive patient.
* You cannot institute a surcharge for unruly or surly patients.
* It is not necessary to have a pet name for your cardiac monitor.
* As long as stupidity remains epidemic in the US, you have job security.
    * Corollary: Any patient who chooses to go to jail instead of the hospital has probably been in my rig in the past.
* The First Rule of Equipment: Any piece of Life-saving Equipment will never malfunction or fail until you need it to save a life, or the salesman leaves.
* The Second Rule of Equipment: Interchangeable parts don't, leak proof seals will, and self-starters won't.
* The First Law of Ambulance Operation: No matter how fast you drive when responding to a call, it is never fast enough.
    * Corollary: Until you pass a police cruiser, at which point it will be entirely too fast.
    * Corollary: Unless you are responding to an "officer down" call then it is physically impossible to be travelling fast enough.
* Paramedical Law of Bathroom: If a call is received between 0500 and 0700, the location of the call will always be in a bathroom.
    * Corollary: If you have just gone to the Bathroom, no call will be received.
    * Corollary: If you have not yet gone to the Bathroom, you will soon regret it.
    * Corollary: The probability of receiving a run increases proportionally to the time elapsed since last going to the bathroom.
* Basic Assumption About Dispatchers Law: Given the opportunity, any dispatcher will be only too happy to tell you where to go, regardless of whether or not (s)he actually knows where that may be.
    * Corollary: The existence or non-existence of any given location is of only minor importance to a dispatcher.
    * Corollary: Any street designated as a "Cross-street" by a dispatcher probably isn't.
    * Corollary: If a street name can be mispronounced, a dispatcher will mispronounce it.
    * Corollary: If a street name cannot be mispronounced, a dispatcher will mispronounce it.
    * Corollary: A dispatcher will always refer to a given location in the most obscure manner as possible. E.g., "Stumpy Brown's Cabbage Field" is now covered by a shopping center.
* The First Principle of Triage: In any accident, the degree of injury suffered by a patient is inversely proportional to the amount and volume of agonized screaming produced by that patient.
* The Gross Injury Rule: Any injury, the sight of which makes you want to puke, should immediately be covered by 4x4's and Kerlix.
* The First Law of EMS Supervisors: Given the equation: X - Y = Quality of Care where "X" is the care that you render and "Y" is the assistance supplied by any Supervisor. If you can eliminate "Y" from the equation, the Quality of Care will improve by "X".
    * Corollary: Field Supervisors have no business in the Field.
    * Corollary: The level of technical competence is inversely proportional to the level of management.
    * Corollary: Technology is dominated by those who manage what they do not understand.
* The Law of Protocol Directives: The simplest Protocol Directive will be worded in the most obscure and complicated manner possible. Speeds, for example, will be expressed as "Furlongs per Fortnight" and flow rates as "Hogsheads per Hour".
    * Corollary: If you don't understand it, it must be intuitively obvious.
    * Corollary: If you can understand it, you probably don't.
* The Law of EMS Educators: Those who can't do, teach.
* The Law of EMS Evaluators: Those who can neither do nor teach, evaluate.
* The Paramedical Law of Light: As the seriousness of any given injury increases, the availability of light to examine that injury decreases.
* The Paramedical Law of Space: The amount of space which is needed to work on a patient varies inversely with the amount of space which is available to work on that patient.
* The Paramedical Theory of Relativity: The number of distraught and uncooperative relatives surrounding any given patient varies exponentially with the seriousness of the patient's illness or injury.
* The Paramedical Theory of Weight: The weight of the patient that you are about to transport increases by the square of the sum of the number of floors which must be ascended to reach the patient plus the number of floors which must be descended while carrying the patient.
    * Corollary: Very heavy patients tend to gravitate toward locations which are furthest from mean sea level.
    * Corollary: If the patient is heavy, the elevator is broken, and the lights in the stairwell are out.
* The Rules of Non-Transport: A Life-or-Death situation will immediately be created by driving away from the home of patient who has just thrown you out of their house. The seriousness of this situation will increase as the date of your trial approaches. By the time your ex-patient reaches the witness stand, the Jury will wonder how patient in such terrible condition could have possibly walked to the door and greeted you with a large suitcase in each hand.
* The First Rule of Bystanders: Any bystander who offers you help will give you none.
* The Second Rule of Bystanders: Always assume that any Physician found at the scene of an emergency is a Gynecologist, until proven otherwise.
    * Corollary: Never turn your back on a Proctologist.
* The Rule of Warning Devices: Any Ambulance, whether it is responding to a call or traveling to a Hospital, with Lights and Siren, will be totally ignored by all motorists, pedestrians, and dogs which may be found in or near the roads along its route.
    * Corollary: Ambulance Sirens can cause acute and total, but transient, deafness.
    * Corollary: Ambulance Lights can cause acute and total, but transient, blindness. Note: This Rule does not apply in California, where all pedestrians and motorists are apparently oblivious to any and all traffic laws.
* The Law of Show-And-Tell: A virtually infinite number of wide-eyed and inquisitive school-aged children can climb into the back of any Ambulance, and, given the opportunity, invariably will.
    * Corollary: No emergency run will come in until they are all inside the Ambulance and playing with the equipment.
    * Corollary: It will take at least four times as long to get them all out as it took to get them in.
    * Corollary: A vital piece of equipment will be missing.
* The Rule of Rookies: The true value of any rookie EMT, when expressed numerically, will always be a negative number. The value of this number may be found by simply having the rookie grade his or her ability on a scale from 1 to 10.
* For rookie EMT's medical skill: 1 = Certified Health Hazard, 10 = Johnny or Roy.
* For rookie EMT's behind the wheel: 1 = Obstruction to Navigation, 10 = Mario Andretti.
* The true value of the rookie is then found by simply negating the rookie's self-assigned value.
    * Corollary: Treat any rookie assigned to your Unit as you would a Bystander. See The First Rule of Bystanders.
* The Rule of Rules: As soon as an EMS Rule is accepted as absolute, an exception to that Rule will immediately occur. Sent by [Ted Fisher](mailto:tedf@vercomis.org).
