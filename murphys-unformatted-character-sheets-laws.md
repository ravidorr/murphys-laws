#Murphy's Unformatted Character Sheets Laws
* Organized. Complete. Readable. Pick two. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de).
* Murphy's Death Spiral: The longer your campaign goes on, the more ridiculously powerful you'll have to make the villains to present a challenge to your demi-god characters. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de).
    * Corollary: The player of the most powerful character will complain about lacking realism. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de).
* Nobody is lazy; they're busy perfecting their posts they will make really soon, which will be totally awesome. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de).
    * Corollary: You'll have to write it yourself. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de).
* You'll either be overrun by newbie's who have totally cool original new characters (all expressions after 'have' being debatable) who'll quit two days after their introduction to the story, or left totally deserted without players. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de).
* The amount of work that went into planning your new campaign is inversely proportional to how many people will want to play it. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de).
