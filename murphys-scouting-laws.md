#Murphy's Scouting Laws
* Rain always happens when on a hike.
* The shortest way from point A to B is by GPS
* When counting the children in a group, there's always one missing.
* Two rules matter for a scout:
    * Scout leaders are always right.
    * If they are not then rule number 1 is activated.
