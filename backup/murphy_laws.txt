About Murphy's Laws Site (And Me) 
 
About The Murphy's Laws Site 
I created my first page of Murphy's Laws in 1996, as part of my ISP home page. In 
1999 I moved it to its own domain, and it has been growing ever since.  
 
I have received many emails over the years, some with new laws, some with spelling 
corrections, some with requests for new categories, and some with thanks for the fun 
the site has brought.  
 
I have also received a number of emails asking for advice on how to live with 
Murphy's Law. I have answered these as best I can, and have now created a page 
with some of these thoughts. 
 
I hope you enjoy the site, and if you have any comments, please feel free to email 
me.

From: A Reader in the UK 
I was working on a project for a major client, and we were down to the wire. We had 
to deliver the final report by 5:00 PM on Friday, and it was already 4:00 PM. I was 
putting the finishing touches on the report, and I was just about to save it for the last 
time when the power went out. 
 
I was in a panic. I had been working on this report for weeks, and I didn't have a 
backup. I was sure that I was going to have to start all over again. 
 
I called the power company, and they told me that the power would be out for at least 
an hour. I was devastated. I was sure that I was going to miss my deadline. 
 
I was just about to give up when I remembered that I had a laptop in my car. I ran 
out to my car, and I was able to finish the report on my laptop. I delivered the report 
with only minutes to spare. 
 
I was so relieved that I had been able to finish the report on time. I was also very 
grateful that I had a laptop. I don't know what I would have done without it. 
 
From: A Reader in the US 
I was on my way to a job interview, and I was running late. I was driving as fast as I 
could, but I was still not going to make it on time. I was just about to give up when I 
saw a police car in my rearview mirror. 
 
I was sure that I was going to get a ticket. I was already late for my interview, and 
now I was going to have to deal with a ticket. I was so frustrated. 
 
I pulled over, and the police officer came to my window. He asked me why I was in 
such a hurry. I told him that I was on my way to a job interview, and I was running 
late. 
 
The police officer was very understanding. He told me that he would give me an 
escort to my interview. I was so grateful. I was able to make it to my interview on 
time, and I got the job. 
 
I was so relieved that I had been able to make it to my interview on time. I was also 
very grateful to the police officer who had helped me. I don't know what I would have 
done without him.

Murphy's Law Origin 
 
There are many stories about the origin of Murphy's Law. The most popular story is 
that it was named after Captain Edward A. Murphy, an engineer working on a U.S. 
Air Force project in 1949. 
 
Captain Murphy was working on a project to see how much deceleration a person 
could withstand. He had designed a harness with 16 sensors to measure the force 
of the deceleration. There were two ways to attach the sensors to the harness, and 
someone had attached all 16 of them the wrong way. 
 
When Captain Murphy found out about the mistake, he said, "If there are two or 
more ways to do something, and one of those ways can result in a catastrophe, then 
someone will do it." 
 
The project manager, George E. Nichols, called this "Murphy's Law." 
 
Another story is that Murphy's Law was named after a character in a 1940s radio 
show called "The Sad Sack." The Sad Sack was a bumbling soldier who was always 
getting into trouble. 
 
Whatever the origin, Murphy's Law has become a popular expression for anything 
that can go wrong, will go wrong.

Murphy's Laws 
 
If anything can go wrong, it will. 
 
Nothing is as easy as it looks. 
 
Everything takes longer than you think. 
 
If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the 
most damage will be the one to go wrong. 
 
If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which a procedure can go wrong, 
and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will promptly develop. 
 
Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse. 
 
Whenever you set out to do something, something else must be done first. 
 
Every solution breeds new problems. 
 
It is impossible to make anything foolproof because fools are so ingenious. 
 
Nature always sides with the hidden flaw. 
 
Mother Nature is a bitch. 
 
It is impossible to know the length of a minute without knowing the side of the 
bathroom door you're on. 
 
If you're feeling good, don't worry. You'll get over it. 
 
No matter how long or hard you shop for an item, after you've bought it, it will be on 
sale somewhere cheaper. 
 
Anytime things appear to be going better, you have overlooked something. 
 
If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs, then you just don't 
understand the seriousness of the situation. 
 
If you can't convince them, confuse them. 
 
If you can't win, arrange for a tie. 
 
If you can't get out of it, get into it. 
 
If you can't find it, it's not there. 
 
If you can't fix it, feature it. 
 
If you can't hide it, flaunt it. 
 
If you can't remember it, forget it. 
 
If you can't stop it, enjoy it. 
 
If you can't think of an answer, ask a question. 
 
If you can't understand it, it's obvious. 
 
If you can't see it, it's not there. 
 
If you can't sell it, sit on it. 
 
If you can't tell, it doesn't matter. 
 
If you can't win, change the rules. 
 
If you can't win, cheat. 
 
If you can't win, quit. 
 
If you don't care where you are, you ain't lost. 
 
If you don't do it, you don't get it. 
 
If you don't know what you're doing, do it neatly. 
 
If you don't want to get caught, don't do it. 
 
If you have a difficult task, give it to a lazy person -- they will find an easier way to 
do it. 
 
If you have to ask, you can't afford it. 
 
If you have to choose between two evils, pick the one you've never tried before. 
 
If you have to do something, do it. 
 
If you have to eat a frog, don't look at it too long. 
 
If you have to go, you have to go. 
 
If you have to lie, be brief. 
 
If you have to say something, say it. 
 
If you have to swallow a frog, don't look at it too long. 
 
If you have to tell a lie, make it a good one. 
 
If you have to walk on eggs, don't hop. 
 
If you have to, you have to. 
 
If you're in a hole, stop digging. 
 
If you're not confused, you're not paying attention. 
 
If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. 
 
If you're not the lead dog, the scenery never changes. 
 
If you're not winning, you're losing. 
 
If you're not sure what to do, do nothing. 
 
If you're not supposed to do it, do it. 
 
If you're not willing to be a fool, you can't be a winner. 
 
If you're not willing to learn, no one can help you. If you're determined to learn, no 
one can stop you. 
 
If you're not willing to risk it all, you'll never have it all. 
 
If you're not willing to take a chance, you'll never have a chance. 
 
If you're not willing to work for it, you don't deserve it. 
 
If you're not willing to, you're not willing to. 
 
If you're not winning, you're not trying hard enough. 
 
If you're not winning, you're not playing the right game. 
 
If you're not winning, you're not supposed to be winning. 
 
If you're not winning, you're not supposed to be playing. 
 
If you're not winning, you're not supposed to be. 
 
If you're not winning, you're not. 
 
If you're not winning, you're. 
 
If you're not winning. 
 
If you're not. 
 
If you're. 
 
If.
