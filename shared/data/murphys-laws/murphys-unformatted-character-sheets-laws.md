* Organized. Complete. Readable. Pick two. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de). 
* Murphy's Death Spiral: The longer your campaign goes on, the more ridiculously powerful you'll have to make the villains to present a challenge to your demi-god characters. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de). 
 * Corollary: The player of the most powerful character will complain about a lack of realism. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de). 
* Nobody is lazy; they're busy perfecting their posts, which they will make soon, which will be awesome. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de). 
 * Corollary: You'll have to write it yourself. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de). 
* You'll either be overrun by newbies who have too original new characters (all expressions after 'have' being debatable) who'll quit two days after their introduction to the story, or left deserted without players. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de). 
* The amount of work that went into planning your new campaign is inversely proportional to the number of people who want to play it. Sent by [Robert Mueller](mailto:gatac@t-online.de).
