# Murphy's Technology Laws

* Logic is a systematic method of coming to the wrong conclusion with confidence.
* Whenever a system becomes completely defined, some damn fool discovers something which either abolishes the system or expands it beyond recognition.

* The opulence of the front office decor varies inversely with the fundamental solvency of the firm.
* A computer's attention span is only as long as its electrical cord.
* An expert knows more and more about less and less until he knows everything about nothing.
* Tell a man there are 300 billion stars in the universe, and he'll believe you. Tell him a bench has wet paint on it, and he'll have to touch it to be sure.

* Nothing motivates a man more than to see his boss putting in an honest day's work.
* Some people manage the book, even though they don't know who wrote it or what book it is.
* The primary function of the design engineer is to make things difficult for the fabricator and impossible for the serviceman.
* To spot the expert, choose the one who predicts the job will take the longest and cost the most.
* After all is said and done, a hell of a lot more is said than done.
* Any circuit design must contain at least one obsolete part, two unobtainable parts, and three parts still under development.

* If you get the incorrect answer mathematically, multiply by the page number.
* Computers are unreliable, but humans are even more unreliable.
