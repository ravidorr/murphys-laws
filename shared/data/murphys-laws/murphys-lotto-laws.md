# Murphy's Lotto Laws

* You check the paper and find that you have all six numbers, but then you find that the newspaper misprinted two.
* The Jackpot gets to $40,000,000, and the numbers match all the
* numbers on your lotto slip, but you forgot to buy your ticket.
* The Jackpot gets to $40,000,000, and you finally win, then you find out
* Three thousand others also took first place.
* You matched four numbers, but you lost your ticket.
* You've been playing the same numbers in the Lottery since its beginning. Then they change the Lottery game, saying it's what the people want. (You know it's just to make it harder to win so they can make more money.)
* The only time you win, it's a pitifully small amount.
* Your spouse wins, then leaves you.
* You finally hit it big, and then you discover all the friends you never had.
* You finally hit it big, then you die the same day.
* Whoever wins is already rich or has won at least once before. Sent by [David "The Fish"](mailto:swimfish2000@hotmail.com)
