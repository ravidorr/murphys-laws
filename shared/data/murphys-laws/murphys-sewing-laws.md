# Murphy's Sewing Laws

* Fusible interfacings always fuse to the iron. 
* The serge only eats the customer's garment. 
* You will find five buttons in your box if you need six. 
* The seam you meant to rip out is invariably the other one. 
* When you are in a hurry, the needle eye is always too small. 
* The fabric you forgot to pre-shrink will always shrink the most. 
* The pattern you wanted to make again will have one key piece missing. 
* If you drop something out of your sewing basket, it will be your box of pins, with the cover off. 
* Whenever the construction process is going well, the bobbin thread runs out. 
* The magnitude of the goof is in direct proportion to the cost of the fabric. 
* While walking barefoot, your lost needle will be found by your son, husband, or brother-in-law. 
* Facings tend to be sewn to the wrong side. 
 * Corollary: Opposite sides attract. 
* Collar points don't match, and you've trimmed all the seams. 
* The iron never scorches the garment until its final pressing. 
* The steam iron only burps rusty water on light silk fabric. 
* The sewing machine light usually burns out on Sunday. 
* Pinking shears get dull just by looking at them. 
* Gathering threads always breaks in the middle. 
* The scissors cut easiest past the buttonhole. 
* Matching edges don't. Sent by [Barb](mailto:pineglen@discover-net.net). 
* You will spill your pin box once per garment. Sent by [Barb](mailto:pineglen@discover-net.net), on behalf of his sister. 
* As ye sew, so shall ye rip. Sent by [EJ Mott](mailto:ejmott@mchsi.com), passed to her by her grandmother.
