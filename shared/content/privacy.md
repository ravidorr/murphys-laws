# Privacy Policy

Murphy's Law Archive is built for curious, privacy-conscious readers. This policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we protect your trust while you browse, submit laws, and share your stories.

## What We Collect

### Information You Share

When you submit a law, send feedback, or subscribe to updates, you may share your name, email address, and the content you contribute. Sharing is optional - the archive welcomes anonymous submissions.

### Activity Signals

Our servers automatically receive technical basics like IP address, device and browser details, pages visited, and time on page. These signals help us keep the site reliable and understand what content resonates.

## How We Use Data

- **Operate the archive:** Render pages, route navigation, and surface the laws you love.
- **Celebrate community contributions:** Display submitted laws and stories with proper attribution.
- **Improve the experience:** Analyze patterns to refine navigation, search, and performance.
- **Keep things safe:** Detect misuse, abuse, or unauthorized access.
- **Stay in touch:** Respond when you reach out or request updates.

## Cookies & Analytics

We use lightweight first-party cookies and privacy-focused analytics to understand traffic trends. They remember preferences like dark mode and help us learn which calculators or laws people return to most. You can clear or block cookies through your browser without breaking the site.

**Third-party advertising cookies:** We use Google AdSense to display advertisements on our site. Google and its partners may use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements. You can learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps by visiting [How Google uses data](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting [Google's Ad Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).

## Third-Party Services

When enabled, services such as email delivery providers or advertising networks may process limited information to send notifications or measure reach. We require these partners to honor strong privacy safeguards and only share the minimum necessary data.

**Google AdSense:** We use Google AdSense to serve advertisements. Google may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from our website and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. Third parties, including Google, may place and read cookies on your browser, or use web beacons or IP addresses to collect information as a result of ad serving on our website.

## Data Retention

Submission content remains visible so the archive reflects collective wisdom. Supporting metadata is retained only as long as we have a reason - typically to provide the feature you requested or to comply with legal obligations. When data is no longer needed, we delete or anonymize it.

## Your Choices

- **Control submissions:** Request edits or removal of content you provided.
- **Access information:** Ask what data we have collected about you.
- **Opt out:** Disable cookies, unsubscribe from updates, or decline analytics participation.
- **Reach out:** Contact us for clarification before sharing personal details.

## Security Practices

We apply encryption in transit, strict access controls, and regular reviews of our systems. While no website can promise absolute security, we respond quickly to issues and keep backups isolated from public infrastructure.

## Global Visitors

Murphy's Law is universal, and so are our visitors. Data may be processed in the United States and other regions where our providers operate. Using the site means you consent to that transfer, and we rely on standard contractual safeguards when required.

## Updates

We review this policy whenever new features launch or regulations change. When updates happen, we adjust the date at the top and summarize material changes so you can stay informed.
