# About Murphy's Law Archive

Murphy's Law Archive preserves and celebrates the world's favorite truism about inevitable mishaps. What started as a personal collection has become a living repository for witty observations, cautionary tales, and the humor we need when plans go sideways.

## What is Murphy's Law?

> "Anything that can go wrong, will." - Capt. Edward A. Murphy Jr.

Born out of an Air Force experiment in 1949, Murphy's Law captured a universal truth: when the stakes are high and complexity reigns, something eventually slips. Over the decades, this simple idea has multiplied into corollaries, variations, and stories from every corner of life, each reminding us to prepare, adapt, and laugh.

Founder **Raanan Avidor** launched the archive in the late 1990s after a single Murphy moment on a Geocities page sparked an avalanche of emails. That snowball grew into a structured archive, a modern web app, and a shared space for everyone who appreciates the instructional power of things going wrong.
