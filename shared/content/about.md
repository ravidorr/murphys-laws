# About Murphy's Law Archive

Murphy's Law Archive preserves and celebrates the world's favorite truism about inevitable mishaps. What started as a personal collection has become a living repository for witty observations, cautionary tales, and the humor we need when plans go sideways.

## What is Murphy's Law?

> "Anything that can go wrong, will." - Capt. Edward A. Murphy Jr.

Born out of an Air Force experiment in 1949, Murphy's Law captured a universal truth: when the stakes are high and complexity reigns, something eventually slips. Over the decades, this simple idea has multiplied into corollaries, variations, and stories from every corner of life, each reminding us to prepare, adapt, and laugh.

## Our Editorial Standards

Murphy's Law is funny, but it's also useful when it helps people design better systems. We review submissions to keep the archive helpful and credible:

- **Clear sourcing:** We prioritize laws with a known origin, widely cited wording, or a plausible story behind them.
- **Actionable insight:** We look for patterns that teach people how to reduce risk, not just complain about it.
- **Respectful tone:** Humor is welcome; harassment or harmful stereotypes are not.
- **No spam:** Submissions that are promotional or copied from unrelated sources are rejected.

Every contribution is reviewed by a human before it appears in the public archive. Popular entries rise through community votes, but we keep the original wording and attribution intact.

## How We Organize the Archive

Each law is tagged by topic so readers can scan for patterns. Categories include tech, engineering, travel, healthcare, finance, education, and everyday life. When a law fits multiple domains, we list it in every relevant category so it can be discovered in context.

We also maintain an "Examples" collection that highlights how a law played out in a real situation. These stories add detail that helps explain why the law matters and how people responded.

## How It Happened

Founder **Raanan Avidor** launched the archive in the late 1990s after a single Murphy moment on a Geocities page sparked an avalanche of emails. That snowball grew into a structured archive, a modern web app, and a shared space for everyone who appreciates the instructional power of things going wrong.

## Why It Matters

- **Stress relief:** Humor diffuses the tension when the worst happens.
- **Preparedness:** Knowing the patterns helps us plan for the unexpected.
- **Shared experience:** Murphy's Laws resonate across cultures, professions, and generations.
- **Perspective:** Laughing at the chaos keeps us resilient.
