# Claude Code Configuration for Murphy's Laws Project

## SSH Usage
- ALWAYS read ~/.ssh/config before using SSH commands
- Available SSH hosts:
  - murphys-main or murphys: Main server (murphys-laws.com)
  - murphys-n8n: n8n automation server (45.55.74.28)
- Both use the id_ed25519_digitalocean key

## Deployment
- Deployment is automatic via GitHub Actions
- Simply push to main branch - no need to run `npm run deploy`
- GitHub Actions handle the deployment to production

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- Backend scripts are in backend/scripts/
- Production database location: /root/murphys-laws/backend/murphys.db
- Production API runs as root user from /root/murphys-laws/backend/
- Log analyzer runs daily via cron
- Never overwrite the production database

## Reviewing Law Submissions
- The production database is only accessible as root
- To review submissions interactively:
  1. SSH into server: ssh murphys-main
  2. Switch to root: sudo -i
  3. Navigate to scripts: cd /root/murphys-laws/backend/scripts
  4. Run review CLI: node review-laws.mjs
- Cannot review submissions via non-interactive SSH (requires terminal input)
