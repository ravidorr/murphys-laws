#Murphy's Volunteer Bushfire Brigade Laws
* Don't look conspicuous. When you’re dealing with the public it draws stupid questions. Back on Station it draws Crew Leaders.
* There is always an easy way.
    * Corrlary: The easy way usually results in more damage done than less or is blocked by a large, pissed off dog who hasn't eaten in a week.
* When dealing with the public try to look unimportant, They may go and find someone else to ask that stupid question to.
* Falling trees have the right of way.
* Uniforms only come in two sizes, too small and too large.
* If your Captain can see you then so can the public.
* Never worry about the falling tree branch with your name on it.
* Instead, worry about the falling tree addressed, "To whom it may concern".
* If orders can be misunderstood, they have been.
* It isn't necessary to be an idiot to be a senior officer, but it sure helps.
* Crew Leaders, not GOD, make priorities. There’s a difference.
* Never stand when you can sit, never sit when you can lie down, never stay awake when you can sleep.
* Never tell the Captain or Deputy Captain you have nothing to do.
* Crew leaders and above never watch until you make a mistake.
* One Crew leader is never enough but two is entirely too many.
* A clean and dry set of overalls is a magnet for mud and rain.
* The worse the weather, the more you are required to be out in it.
* The more an item of equipment costs, the farther you have to send it away to be repaired.
* Field experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.
* Interchangeable parts - don't.
* Leak proof seals - will.
* Self-starters - won’t.
* The item of equipment that usually won’t start or jams when you need it the most is the pump.
* You aren't Superman.
* If it's stupid but it works, it ain't stupid.
* The important things are always simple.
    * Corrlary: The simple things are always hard.
* Beer Math -> 2 beers times 37 men equals 49 cases.
* Don't ever be the first, don't ever be the last and don't ever volunteer to do anything.
* The more stupid the leader is, the more important tasks he is ordered to carry out.
* The self-importance of a Deputy Captain is inversely proportional to his actual importance in the chain of command.
* Success occurs when no one is looking, failure occurs when the Fire Control Officer is watching.
* As soon as you are served hot food in the field, it rains.
If only one solution can be found for a field problem, then it is usually a stupid solution.
