#Murphy's Real Estate Laws
* That sweet little girl with the baby that you rented to, will start dating the mad motorcycle man from hell, and several of his friends, the very next week.
* Tenants have at least one relative get sick or die per month, so they will just have to pay you later.
* If a tenant attempts to replace the washer in a faucet, plan on replacing the faucet, perhaps all the plumbing in the building.
* Prospective tenants who make an appointment to see your rental across town, often get kidnapped on the way there, so there was just no way they could call you.
* Tenants only lock themselves out in the middle of the night, or on Christmas.
* When a furnace breaks in mid-winter, it is always the heat exchanger.
* At least one tenant's check will be "lost in the mail" every month.
* Every lost pet will find its way to your rental.
* The hardware store closes five minutes before you get there.
* A tenant's ability to see dirt and damage is much greater when the move in than when they move out.
* Your best tenants always get job transfers during the worst rental markets.
* Everything in your rentals will break 100 times faster than in your own home.
* The insurance inspector always shows up to take photos of the building as you are putting the evicted tenantâ€™s possessions on the curb.
* Tenants always swear under oath that the window was broken when they moved in.
* When a tenant calls and says, "Hi, how are you?" something is drastically wrong.
* If it exists, your tenant will try to flush it down the toilet.
* If you have any questions about anything, ask your tenants.
* If it is pouring rain, you can be sure the windows are open at one or more at your units.
* Proper disposal of chewing gum is on the carpet.
