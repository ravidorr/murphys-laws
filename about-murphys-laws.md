#How did the  Murphy Laws Site came to life?
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, 
I'm Raanan Avidor, born in 1970, happly married, and we have 3 wonderful kids.

I love to read, especially science fiction, and my favorite writer is Larry Niven (yes, I'm a geek).
Larry Niven mentioned Murphy's Laws in his stories a few times.

I strated to tinker with computers in the early '80 (told you I'm a geek).
In the late '90 I've opned a homepage in Geocities.
I didn't have anything interesting to say, I just wanted to learn HTML. You can guess I didn't have a lot of hits to that site :-) (BTW did you know that the first :-) first appeared on 19 September, 1982? [Check it out](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/sefSmiley.htm).

One day I posted about something that happened to me that reminded me of Murphy's Law.
The next day I got some e-mails about Murphy's Law.
After requesting the writers for their permissions, I posted those emails in the site.
The next day I got more emails.
I started to get e-mails from very interesting people with amazing stories and laws.
Quickly Murphy's Laws swallowed the entire site.

When Geocities community died and the adds became bigger then the content, I bought a domain, found a hosting service, and created this site. It changed a little over the years, but not very much.
I'm trying to pay the bills with some affilitations and Google AdSense. I get commissions for purchases made through links from this site.
Enjoy! And if you want, you can [drop me a line](mailto:ravidor@gmail.com).
