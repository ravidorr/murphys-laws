# How did the Murphy Laws Site come to life?

üëã Hi,

I'm Raanan Avidor, born in 1970, happily married, and have three wonderful kids.

I love to read, especially science fiction, and my favorite writer is Larry Niven (yes, I'm a geek). In his stories, Larry Niven mentions Murphy's Laws a few times.

I started tinkering with computers in the early '80s (I told you I'm a geek). In the late '90s, I opened a homepage on Geocities. I had nothing interesting to say; I just wanted to learn HTML. I didn't have many hits on that site.  
By the way, did you know that the first ‚Äú:-)‚Äù appeared on 19 September 1982? [Check it out](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/sefSmiley.htm).

One day, I posted about something that happened to me that reminded me of Murphy's Law. The next day, I got some emails about Murphy's Law. After requesting the writers' permissions, I posted those emails on the site. The next day, I got more emails. I started getting emails from interesting people with amazing stories and laws. Quickly, Murphy's Laws swallowed the entire site.

When the Geocities community died and the ads became bigger than the content, I bought a domain, found a hosting service, and created this site. It changed a little over the years, but not much. I'm trying to pay the bills with some affiliations and Google AdSense. I get commissions for purchases made through links from this site. Enjoy\! And if you want, you can [drop me a line](mailto:ravidor@gmail.com).
