#Murphy's Computer Laws
* Any given program, when running, is obsolete.
* Any given program costs more and takes longer each time it is run.
* If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.
* If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.
* Any given program will expand to fill all the available memory.
* The value of a program is inversely proportional to the weight of its output.
* Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the programmer who must maintain it.
* Every non-trivial program has at least one bug.
  * Corollary: A sufficient condition for program triviality is that it have no bugs.
  * Corollary: At least one bug will be observed after the author leaves the organization.
* Bugs will appear in one part of a working program when another 'unrelated' part is modified.
* The subtlest bugs cause the greatest damage and problems.
  * Corollary: A subtle bug will modify storage thereby masquerading as some other problem.
* Lulled into Security Law: A 'debugged' program that crashes will wipe out source files on storage devices when there is the least available backup.
* A hardware failure will cause system software to crash, and the customer engineer will blame the programmer.
* A system software crash will cause hardware to act strangely and the programmers will blame the customer engineer.
* Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable errors, which by definition are limited.
* Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
* Make it possible for programmers to write programs in English, and you will find that programmers cannot write in English.
* The documented interfaces between standard software modules will have undocumented quirks.
* The probability of a hardware failure disappearing is inversely proportional to the distance between the computer and the customer engineer.
* A working program is one that has only unobserved bugs.
* No matter how many resources you have, it is never enough.
* Any cool program always requires more memory than you have.
* When you finally buy enough memory, you will not have enough disk space.
* Disks are always full. It is futile to try to get more disk space. Data expands to fill any void.
* If a program actually fits in memory and has enough disk space, it is guaranteed to crash.
* If such a program has not crashed yet, it is waiting for a critical moment before it crashes.
* All constants are variables.
* Constants aren't.
* Variables won't.
* The most important leg of a three legged stool is the one that is missing.
* 99% of all statistics are false.
* The attention span of a computer is only as long as its power cord.
* Logic is a systematic method of coming to the wrong conclusion with confidence.
* To err is human, but to really foul things up requires a computer.
* He who laughs last probably made a backup.
* If at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0
* All great discoveries are made by mistake.
* The number one cause of computer problems is computer solutions.
* A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works.
* Nothing is foolproof to a sufficiently talented fool.
* The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance.
* If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.
* Ethernet always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account the fact that Ethernet always takes longer than you expect.
* Real programmers don't comment their code. It was hard to write, it should be hard to read.
* Programming is like sex: one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.
* If you give someone a program, you will frustrate them for a day; if you teach them how to program, you will frustrate them for a lifetime.
* The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.
* The number of bugs is proportional to the size and complexity of the program.
* Every program has at least one bug and can be shortened by at least one instruction — from which, by induction, one can deduce that every program can be reduced to one instruction which doesn't work.
* A program is never finished, it's abandoned.
* The most likely source of bugs in your program is your program.
* Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.
* Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.
* No matter how good of a deal you get on computer components, the price will always drop immediately after the purchase.
* All components become obsolete. The speed with which components become obsolete is directly proportional to the price of the component.
* Software bugs are impossible to detect by anybody except the end user.
* The maintenance engineer will never have seen a model quite like yours before.
* Any VDU, from the cheapest to the most expensive, will protect a twenty cent fuse by blowing first.
* If a circuit requires n components, then there will be only n * 1 components in locally-held stocks.
* A failure in a device will never appear until it has passed final inspection.
* A program generator creates programs that are more buggy than the program generator.
