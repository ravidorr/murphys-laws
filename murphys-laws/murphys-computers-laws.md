# Murphy's Computer Laws

* Any given program, when running, is obsolete.  
* Any given program costs more and takes longer each time it is run.  
* If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.  
* If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.  
* Any given program will expand to fill all the available memory.  
* A program's value is inversely proportional to the weight of its output.  
* Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the programmer who must maintain it.  
* Every non-trivial program has at least one bug.  
  * Corollary: A sufficient condition for program triviality is that it has no bugs.  
  * Corollary: At least one bug will be observed after the author leaves the organization.  
* Bugs will appear in one part of a working program when another 'unrelated' part is modified.  
* The subtlest bugs cause the greatest damage and problems.  
  * Corollary: A subtle bug will modify storage, masquerading as another problem.  
* Lulled into Security Law: A 'debugged' program that crashes will wipe out source files on storage devices when there is the least available backup.  
* A hardware failure will cause the system software to crash, and the customer engineer will blame the programmer.  
* A system software crash will cause hardware to act strangely, and the programmers will blame the customer engineer.  
* Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, unlike detectable errors, which by definition are limited.  
* Adding workforce to a late software project makes it later.  
* Allow programmers to write programs in English. You will find that programmers cannot write in English.  
* Documented interfaces between standard software modules will have undocumented quirks.  
* The probability of a hardware failure disappearing is inversely proportional to the distance between the computer and the customer engineer.  
* A working program has only unobserved bugs.  
* No matter how many resources you have, it is never enough.  
* Any cool program always requires more memory than you have.  
* You will not have enough disk space when you finally buy enough memory.  
* Disks are always full. It is futile to try to get more disk space. Data expands to fill any void.  
* If a program fits in memory and has enough disk space, it is guaranteed to crash.  
* If such a program has not crashed yet, it is waiting for a critical moment before it crashes.  
* All constants are variables.  
* Constants aren't.  
* Variables won't.  
* The most important leg of a three-legged stool is the one that is missing.  
* 99% of all statistics are false.  
* A computer's attention span is only as long as its power cord.  
* Logic is a systematic method of coming to the wrong conclusion with confidence.  
* To err is human, but to foul things up requires a computer.  
* He who laughs last probably made a backup.  
* If at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0  
* All great discoveries are made by mistake.  
* The biggest cause of computer problems is computer solutions.  
* A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works.  
* Nothing is foolproof to a sufficiently talented fool.  
* The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance.  
* If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.  
* Ethernet always takes longer than you expect, even when you consider the fact that Ethernet always takes longer than you expect.  
* Real programmers don't comment on their code. It was hard to write; it should be hard to read.  
* Programming is like sex: one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.  
* If you give someone a program, you will frustrate them for a day. If you teach them how to program, you will frustrate them for a lifetime.  
* The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.  
* The number of bugs is proportional to program size and complexity.  
* Every program has at least one bug and can be shortened by at least one instruction, from which, by induction, one can deduce that every program can be reduced to one instruction that doesn't work.  
* A program is never finished; it's abandoned.  
* The most likely source of bugs in your program is your program.  
* Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.  
* Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.  
* No matter how good a deal you get on computer components, the price will always drop immediately after the purchase.  
* All components become obsolete, and the speed at which they become outdated is directly proportional to their price.  
* Software bugs are impossible to detect by anybody except the end user.  
* The maintenance engineer will never have seen a model like yours.  
* Any VDU, from the cheapest to the most expensive, will protect a twenty-cent fuse by blowing first.  
* If a circuit requires n components, there will be only n\*1 component in locally held stocks.  
* A failure in a device will never appear until it has passed final inspection.  
* A program generator creates programs that are more buggy than the program generator.  
* All Constants are Variables. Sent by [Risto Matikainen](mailto:rmatikainen@hotmail.com)
