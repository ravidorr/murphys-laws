* The lighter the rug, the more likely a dropped peanut butter and jelly sandwich will land face down. Sent by [Chase Smith](mailto:ChaseSmithArtist@aol.com).  
* When working up high, the tool you drop will always land to do the most damage to the tool and the object it hits. Sent by [Chase Smith](mailto:ChaseSmithArtist@aol.com).
