# Murphy's Laws of Mechanics

* If it doesn't fit, force it. If it breaks, it needs replacing anyway.  
* If you drop a tool or small part while working on a car, it will roll to the exact center underneath it.  
* You can put anything anywhere if you have enough grease & a big enough hammer. Sent by J.C. Rolston.  
* Any instrument, when dropped, will roll into the least accessible corner.  
  * Corollary: It will not roll if it falls on shag carpeting and is small enough to hide.  
* If you drop a tool or a part, it will roll to the exact center underneath your car, thus extending your repair enjoyment. Sent by [Tim Salo](mailto:tsalo@drew.edu), Madison, NJ.
