            <h1>Sod's Law Calculator</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Quantifying the likelihood of things going wrong, based on the official formula.</p>
            <pre>
                The formula ((U+C+I) x (10-S))/20 x A x 1/(1-sin(F/10)) is a mathematical representation of Sod's Law, developed by a panel of experts commissioned by British Gas. It aims to quantify the likelihood of "anything that can go wrong, will go wrong". 
                Here's a breakdown of the formula:
                U = Urgency: Assigned a score between 1 and 9, indicating how critical the situation is. 
                C = Complexity: Assigned a score between 1 and 9, indicating how complicated the task is. 
                I = Importance: Assigned a score between 1 and 9, indicating how vital the task is. 
                S = Skill: Assigned a score between 1 and 9, indicating the level of expertise involved. 
                A = Activity: This variable represents a separate factor that can influence the outcome, but its specific role in the calculation isn't detailed in the provided information. 
                F = Frequency: Assigned a score between 1 and 9, indicating how often the task is performed. 
                sin(F/10): This part of the formula uses the sine function and the frequency score to introduce a cyclical or periodic element to the calculation, potentially reflecting how frequently errors occur in a repeating process. 
                The formula essentially multiplies the combined urgency, complexity, and importance (adjusted by skill) by a factor related to the frequency of the activity, aiming to produce a score that reflects the probability of something going wrong.

                Factor      Explanation
                Urgency:    how urgent is this task?            (9 = right away, 1 = sometime this year, maybe)
                Importance: how important is this task?         (9 = absolutely critical, 1 = complete waste of time)
                Complexity: how complex is this task?           (2 = "a child could do it", 8 = brain surgery)
                Skill:      what is your skill level for this?  (1 = complete klutz, 9 = expert)
                Frequency:  how often do you have to do this?   (1 = just once, 9 = every day)
